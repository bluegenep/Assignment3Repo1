## 1 Introduction

*Here you introduce the product. Keep this  clean and simple, one or two sentences at most.*

GroceryListManager application helps users to manage their grocery list by providing various user-based functionality to customize and edit their Grocery list. 

## 2 Process Description

*Process description as a set of activities; for each activity, provide the following:*

- *Activity name (verb or verb phrase)*
- *Activity description (concise paragraph)*
- *Entrance criteria (inputs needed for the activity)*
- *Exit criteria (outputs produced by the activity and how you know it has been completed satisfactorily)*

Since we have the stable project defination for our software where the requirements have already been specified, we decided to choose Waterfall Software Development process. 

Software Concept:
	**- Activity description:** At this phase, the detail doument of a software description is provided to the software developers or the requirements Engineers. Software concept document were handed over to us by the customers detailing the specifications of the software product.

	**- Entrance criteria:** The customer must have the concept/idea on what the software product needs to do with its functionalities, definations and specifications. the documentation on the software product information and specification.

	**- Exit criteria:** The customer should provide the document detailing all the information of the product.


- *Requirement Analysis:*
- *Activity description*
	At this development stage, all the requirements of the software product are to be captured. This document should have all the pertaining information regarding the software, its behaviour and specifications. All the brain storming activites to document the detail requirements is done at this phase

- *Entrance criteria*
	To enter this stage, the software concept document must be completed and handed over to the requirement engineers.

- *Exit criteria*
	Almost all of the requirements, specifications should be captured at this phase. Since we are implementing waterfall process, any changes after this phase is harder and expensive to implement.  


- *Architectural Design:*
- *Activity description*
	At this phase, developers co-ordinate with customers to further clarify on the requirements and specifications. Any unclear specifications are discussed and missing pieces are determined. For these requirements, developers draw and document the design diagram for e.g. UML.

- *Entrance criteria*
	To enter this stage, the detail requirements document must be completed and handed over to the developers.

- *Exit criteria*
	Developer and customers must have the design diagram ready before exiting this phase. Both the customers and developers must be satisfied with the design diagram.  


- *Detail Design:*
- *Activity description*
	At this phase, developers and customers revisit again to talk about further questions on design implementation. Any missing part or the confusing details are being talked further so that they are being included on the design part.

- *Entrance criteria*
	To enter this stage, the Architectural design document must be completed and handed over to the developers.

- *Exit criteria*
	Developer and customers must agree upon the design details before proceeding any further. At this point the customer and the developer must have a real idea on how system should behave, what functionalities it should provid and what should be implemented.  


- *Coding and Debugging :*
- *Activity description*
	At this phase, developers write the code to build the system that was designed at the previous phase. Multiple developers work on different components of the software and integrate their code. All the coding, debugging and the unit testing is done at this stage.

- *Entrance criteria*
	To enter this stage, the detail design document must be completed and handed over to the developers for implementation.

- *Exit criteria*
	All the developers must integrate their code to build a complete software. At this point all the code must be compiled and the software should do the functions as described on the design document. 


- *System Testing :*
- *Activity description*
	At this phase, all the integrated code from developer must be passed onto the testers to do the system testing. All the functional, non functional, performance testing is done at this phase to check the specifications, behaviour of the software. The test should give the result as expected by the design.

- *Entrance criteria*
	All the compiled unit tested code from the developers must be compelted before entering this stage.

- *Exit criteria*
	All the integrated code from developers must pass the functional, non functional, sytem integrated, performance testing before the release of the product.
