TipCalculator android app calculates:

 
a)      Respective percentage Tips (15%, 20%, 25%) that each person need to pay for a check amount.

b)      Respective split amount that each person has to pay with different tips percentage (15%, 20%, 25%)

 

The user enters “Check amount” which is a positive number value and the “party size” which is also a positive integer as an input. After entering the total amount and party size the user needs to click on the “Compute Tip” button which will calculate (a) and (b). The user is not allowed to enter any negative numbers for check amount or party size. When entered “0” or empty values, the app prompts with a respective toast message for error.
